# Heatwave-and-blocking
The investigation of heatwave occurrence and the association with blocking 
1) ta2hw.py is used to calculate heatwave occurrence and intensity from daily maximum temperature.
2) hw2event.py is used to create 3D heatwave events and quantify the characteristics of heatwave events.
3) hw_asso.py is used to investigate the association between heatwave and blocking.
4) figure.py and plot_code.py are used to plot figures.
5) hw_blo_basic.py contains some fundamental codes used in other functions.
